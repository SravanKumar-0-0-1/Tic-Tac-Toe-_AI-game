# Tic-Tac-Toe-_AI-game
A Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an unbeatable AI using the Minimax Algorithm. Includes both a command-line interface and a Tkinter-based Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against a friend or a "smart" computer. The computer is powered by the **Minimax Algorithm**, which makes it impossible to beat!

## 📂 Project Structure
- `minmax/` (Folder)
  - `minmax.py` (The main Python code)

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Open the project in **VS Code**.
2. Run the `minmax.py` file.
3. Choose between:
   - **1 (Single Player):** Play against the AI.
   - **2 (Multiplayer):** Play against a friend locally.
4. Enter numbers **1 through 9** to place your mark on the board.



## 🧠 What is the Minimax Algorithm?
The Minimax algorithm is a type of "artificial intelligence" that looks into the future. It calculates every possible move you could make and picks the best counter-move to ensure it either wins or ends in a draw. It essentially "minimizes" its chances of losing.



## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- VS Code (or any terminal)

## 🚀 How to Run
In your terminal, navigate to your folder and type:
```bash
python minmax.py
